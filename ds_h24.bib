  abstract = {Medical and scientific advances are predicated on new knowledge that is robust and reliable and that serves as a solid foundation on which further advances can be built. In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.}

In 2016, a poll conducted by the journalNature reported that more than half (52\%) of scientistssurveyed believed science was facing a ``replicationcrisis'' (Baker 2016). More recently, some authors have moved tomore positive terms for describing this episode in science; forexample, Vazire (2018) refers instead to a ``credibilityrevolution'' highlighting the improved methods and open sciencepractices it has motivated.},

This paper examines whether data on observed commuting patterns can replace or supplement gravity-based measures representing the commuting potential at specific locations. We use data from a region in Western Norway,and we find that measures based on observed commuting flows and commuting time cannot replace a gravity-based measure of labour market accessibility. Based on, inter alia, the spatial Durbin estimator we find that measures of observed commuting flows increase the explanatory power of a hedonic house price model.},

We present and use some basic acknowledged spatial model alternatives and a battery of relevant tests. Geographically weighted regression, semiparametric analysis, and the mixed spatial Durbin model are also applied. The purpose is to detect missing spatial variables, misspecified functional form and spatial heterogeneity in estimated parameters. Such misspecifications have been shown to give spurious results in relation to some frequently used directional based tests. We achieve significant model improvement, so the paper should be of general interest as an example of practical econometric modelling within the field.}
